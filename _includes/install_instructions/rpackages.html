  <h3>R Packages</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> has a variety of existing 
    and pre-built packages that ease the burden of analysis. We will be
    using a few of these packages to complete the lesson taught at this 
    workshop. 
    <br><br>Please only complete this step <strong>AFTER</strong> 
    successfully installing R and Rstudio above
  </p>

          Install R by downloading and running
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>
          from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
          Also, please install the
          <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
          Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
          installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
          administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
          for example when installing R packages.
